### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (Specific version used: 3.11.4)
- MySQL Database
- Django
- Django Rest Framework... **_(see requirements.txt for complete list)_**

#### Installation

- Clone the repository:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/CDiala/online-notes-api
  cd online-notes-api
  ```

- Create and activate a virtual environment using [this guide](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or run

  ```
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- Install the required packages:

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Install MySQL and create a new MySQL database using [the official guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/) for your specific OS.

  - NB: For Mac users, in the event of installing mysqlclient via pipenv, if pipfile.lock canâ€™t be locked, run the following commands to fix it (Ref: https://forum.codewithmosh.com/t/pipenv-install-mysqlclient-issues/21727/2):

  ```c
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

  brew install mysql pkg-config

  pipenv install mysqlclient

  ```

- Create an app password [here](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en). You'll need the password in the next step.

- Add the following to your **Settings** file:

  ```json
  import os
  ...
  DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': os.environ.get('DB_ENGINE'),
        'NAME': os.environ.get('DB_NAME'),
        'HOST': os.environ.get('DB_HOST'),
        'USER': os.environ.get('DB_USER'),
        'PASSWORD': os.environ.get('DB_PASS'),
    }
  }
  ```

- For debugging, set **`DEBUG`** to **`True`**

- Create a .env file in the root folder, and setup the following variables. Ensure there are no white spaces between keys and values **[e.g. SECRET_KEY=mY-sEcReT_KeY]**, and values shouldn't be quoted.

  ```
  SECRET_KEY
  JWT_SECRET
  DB_ENGINE
  DB_NAME
  DB_HOST
  DB_USER
  DB_PASS
  SMTP_BACKEND
  SMTP_HOST
  SMTP_USER
  SMTP_PASS
  SMTP_PORT
  SMTP_USE_TLS
  ```

  - Hint:

  ```
  DB_ENGINE => Use django.db.backends.mysql as the value in your .env file
  DB_NAME => Your preferred database name
  DB_HOST => Set value in .env file to localhost
  DB_USER => This is your email address where you created the app password
  DB_PASS => This is your app password (without whitespaces)
  ```

- Apply migrations:

  ```
  python3 manage.py makemigrations
  python3 manage.py migrate
  ```

- Create a new superuser

  ```
  python3 manage.py createsuperuser
  ```

- Start the development server:

  ```
  python3 manage.py runserver [port]
  ```

  The app will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or any port specified above
